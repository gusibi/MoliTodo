**Release Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.2  
**Type**: Feature Update  

## ü•ö Easter Egg Feature Release

### üìä Database Task Details View

v1.0.2 introduces a hidden developer-friendly feature that provides complete transparency into the application's data storage layer. This easter egg feature is designed for advanced users, developers, and anyone curious about how MoliTodo stores and manages task data.

## üì• Download and Installation

### Download Links
- **macOS**: `MoliTodo-1.0.2-x64.dmg` (Intel) / `MoliTodo-1.0.2-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: `MoliTodo Setup 1.0.2.exe`

### üçé Important for macOS Users

Since the application is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, macOS users need to execute the following command after first installation or each update to remove system quarantine restrictions:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MoliTodo.app
```

**When to Execute**:
- After first installation
- After each application update
- When encountering "Cannot open application" prompts

**Steps**:
1. Open Terminal
2. Copy and paste the command above
3. Enter administrator password to confirm
4. Restart MoliTodo

**Why is this needed?**
Apple's Gatekeeper security feature blocks unsigned applications by default. This command safely allows MoliTodo to run while maintaining your system's security for other applications.
